# Discord Bot for Hetzner Cloud

This is a bot that helps you check your cloud status, start up new servers, shut down servers (after snapshotting), and auto-shutdown servers.

## Create a Bot on Discord

- OAuth2 Scopes: bot. Text permissions: send messages
- Message content intent (TODO do without since only receive DM?)
- Create test server, and add bot to it by visiting OAuth2 URL

Have to create a server because Discord doesn't support adding bot as friend:
